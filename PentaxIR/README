# PentaxIR

This is an automated Pentax IR trigger for taking multiple long exposures. I designed this primarily for use in astrophotography.

### Modes of Operation:
There are currently two modes of operation:

 1. **Bulb** Mode: This is the default mode. Issue a shutter command at the beginning and end of the exposures.
 2. **Delay** Mode: This mode issues a shutter command to start the exposure. The camera will end the exposure after its configured shutter time.

### Controlling PentaxIR:
The device is controlled by use of a single button. There are a couple different types of button presses

 - Command Presses: These presses are short, less than 1 second in duration. Command presses are used to set the mode of operation.
	- One quick press begins auto triggering.
	- Two quick presses put the device into **Bulb** mode.
	- Three quick presses put the device into **Delay** mode.
- Long Press: A button press greater than 1 second will start setting the exposure length or the delay time. While the button is pressed the red LED will blink. Depending on mode, each flash represents:
	- **Bulb** Mode: Each flash represents 1 minute of exposure.
	- **Delay** Mode: Each flash represents 1 second of time between exposures.
